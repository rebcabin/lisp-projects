          This is a super simple number guessing game. It's also designed to illustrate what it's like to work within a REPL.

          This is a simple text adventure game. It can't be "won" yet, because it needs additional commands from chapter 17. It includes the customized REPL code from chapter 6.

          This is a library for interfacing with graphviz, letting you draw pretty graphs from CLISP. If you are using SBCL, you may want to look <a href="http://blog.ciaranbradley.com/crossing-the-streams-land-of-lisp-chapter-12-0">here</a> for some useful info.

          This implements a version of "Hunt the Wumpus". It requires that <i>grap-util.lisp</i> is in the same directory. Type "(new game)" and then use the "(walk #)" and "(charge #)" commands. The graphs are written to a file <i>known-city.dot.png</i> which you can view in a browser and refresh after each move.

          This is basically a battle engine like you might find in an old-school rpg game. It is actually kind of addicting as a stand-alone game, as well. It teaches object oriented and generic programming.

          The first file implements a crude DSL for creating SVG images.<br>
          The second file adds special actions to the <a>Wizard's Game</a>, completing the game play. It requires <i>wizards_game.lisp</i> in the same directory to work properly.

          The first file implements a simple <i>lazy list</i> library.<br>

          This file turns dice of doom into a crude browser-based game with graphics. It is so crude that it can only support one player using the "site" at a time. It requires the earlier <i>Dice of Doom</i> files and <i>webserver.lisp</i> to be in the same directory.

          This ties up some loose ends for the Dice of Doom game, to turn it into a rich dice rolling board game with a large board. It allows for multiple AI players. It has the same file requirements as <i>dice_of_doom_v3.lisp</i> from chapter 19.
